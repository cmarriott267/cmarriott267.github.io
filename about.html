    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    
        <p>
        My name is Caitlin Marriott and I'm a sophmore at the University of Rhode Island. I have three older sisters as well <br>
        as two dogs and a cat. I'm a commuter student at URI and I'm currently a mechanical engineering major. I enjoy maths <br>
        and sciences but one of my great passions has always been art. I also love computers and I've had fun coding in the <br>
        past! I'm taking CSC 106 this semester because I'm thinking of possibly switching my major to Computer Science. I <br>
        hope to continue with coding - regardless of my major - because I believe it's extremely valuable in todays world. <br>
